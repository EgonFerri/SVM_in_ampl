# Support Vector Machines in AMPL
This report presents the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. We will need to first talk about margins and the idea of separating data with a large gap. Next, we will talk about the optimal margin classifier, which will lead us to talk about the duality for the SVM. We will also implement SVMs in AMPL on random generated data with primal and dual formulations, and finally, we will close off our report with a classic iris dataset example analysis.
